**Project Description:**

An online web-based simulator that allows users to set up and emulate various development boards such as Raspberry Pi, Toradex boards, and Ubuntu environments using QEMU and Docker. This platform will provide a seamless and flexible environment for testing and development. More details will be shared during our meeting.

**Project Goals**
1. Create an Interactive Web-Based Simulator
- Develop a user-friendly web interface that allows users to configure, emulate, and interact with various development boards.
2. Support Multiple Development Boards
- Enable emulation of Raspberry Pi, Toradex boards, and Ubuntu environments using QEMU and Docker.
3. Seamless User Experience
- Provide an intuitive setup process for launching emulations with minimal configuration.
- Implement real-time feedback and monitoring for users.
4. Scalable & Flexible Architecture
- Use QEMU for hardware emulation and Docker for containerized environments to support multiple board configurations.
- Ensure the system can scale to handle multiple users running simulations simultaneously.
5. Enable Development & Testing Features (stretch)
- Allow users to upload and run code, configure networking, and integrate external tools.
- Support common developer workflows like SSH access and file transfer.
6. Security & Resource Management (stretch)
- Implement user session management and resource allocation limits to prevent excessive system load.
7. Documentation & Knowledge Sharing (requirement)
- Provide comprehensive guides, tutorials, and API documentation for users.
